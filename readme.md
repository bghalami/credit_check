# Questions

1. What are you proud of?
    I ran into a huge problem with understanding the algorithm. I'm proud of working through it, and continuing to try to understand it even though it was frustrating. Once I got it it made me feel like I could work through anything.
1. What do you need to improve?
    I need to follow instructions better. I skipped iteration 3 and moved straight to iteration 4. Once I had completed that I went back to 3 and realized testing would be much harder and had to revert a lot of my code to make it work for 3.
1. What questions do you still have?
    I'm not sure. I got it to work so I feel like I'm still in a "I don't know what I don't know stage"

# Rubric - 3

## Functionality - 3

Notes:
  I need to make it take an argument and test it.
- [x] Student completes through Iteration 3

## Mechanics - 3

Notes:
  I could probably dry up my code a little
The student(s):

- [x] appropriately uses Strings, Integers, Floats, Ranges, Symbols, Nils, Arrays, and Hashes
- [x] implements best-choice enumerable methods to iterate over collections
- [x] uses boolean expressions and flow control structures to logically manage a program's flow
- [x] uses methods, arguments, and return values to break code into logical components
- [x] creates Classes that utilize instance variables, attribute accessors, and instance methods

## Design - 3

Notes:

The student(s):

- [x] adheres to the Single Responsibility and DRY principles
- [x] creates Objects and Classes that appropriately encompass state and behavior
- [x] uses instance and local variables appropriately
- [x] writes readable code with the following characteristics:
    * Variable and method names are self explanatory
    * Methods are under 7 lines
    * Lines of code are under 80 characters
    * Project directory structure adheres to convention
    * A linter reports less than 5 errors

## Testing - 3

Notes:
  It's messy, but it works.
The student(s):

- [x] writes Minitest tests that describe the expected behavior of a program according to technical specifications
- [x] names and orders tests so that a test file reads like documentation
- [x] writes Minitest assertions that accurately test a piece of functionality
- [ ] writes a test before writing code that implements the behavior to make that test pass
- [ ] writes both integration and unit tests

## Version Control - 3

Notes:
  Stop breaking my git...
The student(s):

- [x] hosts their code on the master branch of their remote repository
- [ ] makes commits in small chunks of functionality
- [x] submits and merges Pull Requests using the Github interface
